## Motivation

A ***CRUD*** (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete) application is one of the smallest, non-trivial application that can be written for a language or framework. As someone who's learning **Python** and the web development framework **Flask**, I decided to practice my skills with the classic ***To-Do App***.

The ***Flask To-Do App*** uses **Flask** and **MySQL** for backend, and **Bootstrap** plus some custom *CSS* for the front end.
